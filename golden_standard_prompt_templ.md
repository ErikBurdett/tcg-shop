You are a senior Python/Pygame engineer working in this repo.

Goal: <one specific feature or fix>.

Constraints:
- Preserve save compatibility (old saves must load).
- Keep frame pacing smooth: no per-frame font renders for static text; cache surfaces.
- Add/update tests in game/tests.py where relevant.
- Update README.md / PERF.md / UI.md if behavior changes.
- Keep changes minimal and well-structured (prefer new helper modules over giant scene methods).

Deliverables:
1) Brief plan
2) Patch (code changes)
3) Tests updated/added
4) Notes on performance implications
